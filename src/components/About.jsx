    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      After completing my studies in Economics-Education at Lagos State University, 
      I gained experience teaching and mentoring students, which strengthened my
       communication and problem-solving skills. During this time, I discovered my 
       passion for technology and web development, inspiring a transition into the 
       tech field.    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      I am now a Fullstack Developer, building scalable backend systems with Node.js,
       Express, and databases, alongside responsive and intuitive frontends using 
       React, Tailwind CSS, HTML, and CSS. Following best practices and architectures 
       such as MVC, I design applications that are both efficient and user-friendly.    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      My journey combines a strong foundation in education with a passion for technology,
       allowing me to deliver projects that are technically robust and accessible to 
       users.    </p>
